This project involves three scripts that work together to scrape 
movie data from the Everyman Cinema in King's Cross and process it.

1.EveryManSpider.py: This script scrapes film titles and screening times
 from the Everyman Cinema and saves the data in a JSON file.

2.processMovieData.py: This script takes the JSON file (a list of dictionaries)
 and processes it into a new nested dictionary. Each movie title serves as a 
 key, with its metadata (collected via the IMDb API) stored as nested dictionaries 
 (e.g., '{'movie title': {'rating': 7, 'directors': 'J.J. Abrams', ...}}'). This 
 script provides detailed metadata for each movie.

3.findMovie.py: To test the data processing without running the scraper, you can
 use the 'movies.json' file with 'processMovieData.py.' The final data structure is
  saved in 'moviesDict.json,' which you can also use to test the 'findMovie.py' script.
